# Both Numbers Are Even

In this task, you are given a JavaScript file which contains an incomplete function, `bothNumbersAreEven()`. This function takes two arguments `a` and `b`.

You are to complete the function such that:
1. If both parameters `a` and `b` are even numbers, the function should return `true`.
1. If both parameters `a` and `b` are not even numbers, the function should return `false`.
1. If either parameter `a` and `b` is not an even number, the function should return `false`.

Hint: An even number is divisible by 2, hence it does not have a reminder if divided by 2.
