# Week 6 Exercises

This week, the mandatory exercises are:


1. **Both Numbers are Even**:In this exercise, you would implement a function to determine if two given numbers are even or not.

1. **Fizz Buzz**: In this exercise, you would write a program to determine if a given number is divisible by 3 or 5.

1. **Count Characters in String**: In this exercise, you would write a program to count the number of characters in a string.

1. **Can I Drive and Vote**:In this exercise you will write a program to help determine if a person can either drive or vote, based on the person's age and country of residence.

1. **Can I Order Item**: In this exercise, you would implement a function that checks if a specified dish is available in stock.

To solve each exercise, navigate to the exercise folder and follow the instructions in the README.md file.

## Testing

You can use the automated tests to check that your work is valid.

1. Navigate your terminal to the parent exercise folder for the week (not the individual exercise).

2. Install the project dependencies by running `pnpm install`

3. To run all tests for the week, run `pnpm run test`

4. To run the test for a specific exercise, you need to specify the path to the exercise folder, run `pnpm run test exercise-folder`. For example, run `pnpm run test chicken-peanut-stew`

If your solution has all the required elements it should say something like:

```txt
 PASS  ./html-elements.test.js
  The recipe page has the required HTML elements
    ✓ uses at least one heading element (50 ms)
    ✓ uses at least three heading elements (18 ms)
    ✓ uses at least two heading elements (10 ms)
    ✓ uses at least one image element (5 ms)
    ✓ index.html is a valid html doc (193 ms)

If it does not pass one of the tests, you should get some feedback about what is wrong or missing in your solution.
