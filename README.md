# Week 6 Exercises

This week, the mandatory exercises are:


1. **Both Numbers are Even**:In this exercise, you would implement a function to determine if two given numbers are even or not.

1. **Fizz Buzz**: In this exercise, you would write a program to determine if a given number is divisible by 3 or 5.

1. **Count Characters in String**: In this exercise, you would write a program to count the number of characters in a string.

1. **Can I Drive and Vote**:In this exercise you will write a program to help determine if a person can either drive or vote, based on the person's age and country of residence.

1. **Can I Order Item**: In this exercise, you would implement a function that checks if a specified dish is available in stock.



## Testing

1. Navigate your terminal to the parent exercise folder for the week (not the individual exercise).

1. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`

1. To run all tests for the week, run `npm run test`

1. To run the test for a specific exercise, you need to specify the path to the exercise folder, run `npm run test exercise-folder`. For example, run `npm run test chicken-peanut-stew`

<!-- To check that your solution meets the criteria, run `npm run test` in the console. (If you haven't already, you'll need to run `npm install` to install the packages required for testing). -->

If your solution has all the required elements it should say something like:

```txt
 PASS  ./html-elements.test.js
  The recipe page has the required HTML elements
    ✓ uses at least one heading element (50 ms)
    ✓ uses at least three heading elements (18 ms)
    ✓ uses at least two heading elements (10 ms)
    ✓ uses at least one image element (5 ms)
    ✓ index.html is a valid html doc (193 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       5 passed, 5 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        2.104 s
Ran all test suites.
```

If it does not pass one of the tests, you should get some feedback about what is wrong or missing in your solution.

### Valid HTML

The last test for each exercise is that your HTML follows all of the recommended rules for an HTML document.

[Here is a list](https://html-validate.org/rules/index.html) of all the rules that will be automatically checked. You don't have to memorize this list or check each rule yourself. Instead, if you get feedback that your HTML breaks one of the rules, you can find an explanation of the rule from that list.

Once you have passed all tests for the week, then you are ready to submit to Gradescope.

## Submission
In order to get credit for your project, you must:
- push your code to Github Classroom
- submit your work in Gradescope
- submit your project in Woolf

Note that this assignment is automatically graded and you will see your grade shortly after submitting to Gradescope. You have unlimited number of attempts, therefore you are enouraged to modify your work and resubmit as much as possible, before the due date.
